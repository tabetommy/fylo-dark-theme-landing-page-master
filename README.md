## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid.

### What I learned


During this challenge, i learnt particularly how design responsive pages. Given that this is amongst my first webpages, I knew about responsive designing. Practising it was a whole different ball game. However at the end i was able to  to get my images, texts and containers responsive to sreen widths. 


### Continued development

-I intend taking up challenges that includes JS on Frontendmentor to up my skills

- In this project, i learnt by experience the challenges surronding browser supports or the lack thereof.Hence i intend toger more comfortable with CSS grid and flexbox especially related to the lack of complete support by IE11.


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me better understand Flexbox. 
- [Resource 2](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is an amazing article  helped get my head around CSS Grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
